When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

       When I want to work on some project with several people, when I want to have it available anytime from any device to keep working or just to have insight

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
     
       You do not want to burden your local memory with unnecessary data. You might select only the files you want to pull
